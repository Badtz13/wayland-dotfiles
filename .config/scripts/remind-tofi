### Behaviour
#
	# Hide the mouse cursor.
	hide-cursor = false

	# Show a text cursor in the input field.
	text-cursor = true

	# Sort results by number of usages in run and drun modes.
	history = true

	# Specify an alternate file to read and store history information
	# from / to. This shouldn't normally be needed, and is intended to
	# facilitate the creation of custom modes.
	history-file = /home/badtz/.config/scripts/tofi-history

	# Use fuzzy matching for searches.
	fuzzy-match = true

	# If true, require a match to allow a selection to be made. If false,
	# making a selection with no matches will print input to stdout.
	# In drun mode, this is always true.
	require-match = false

	# If true, automatically accept a result if it is the only one
	# remaining. If there's only one result on startup, window creation is
	# skipped altogether.
	auto-accept-single = false
